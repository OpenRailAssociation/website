# OpenRail Association website

Landing website for the OpenRail Association, available under [openrailassociation.org](https://openrailassociation.org).

## Development

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static website generator. The theme is based on top of [HTML5 UP's Story design](https://html5up.net/story) and a [port of the Story theme to Hugo](https://github.com/caressofsteel/hugo-story) made by [@caressofsteel](https://github.com/caressofsteel).
