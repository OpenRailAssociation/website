OpenRail Association is delighted to have participated as a partner in the successful Hack4Rail 2025 hackathon, held from 23 to 25 June in Bern, Switzerland. The event brought together around 170 innovative minds from across the railway industry, working collaboratively in 21 mixed teams to address some of the most pressing challenges faced by rail operators and infrastructure managers today.

Hosted by SBB and chaired by their CIO Jochen Decker, who also serves as our Chair, Hack4Rail focused on multinational cooperation and Open Source solutions under the motto "Connected Railways for Intelligent Solutions". OpenRail Association contributed significantly by providing essential technical infrastructure, financial support, and a collaborative space within our [playground at GitHub](https://github.com/OpenRail-Playground) to facilitate open-sourcing of challenges from the start.

The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many challenges naturally initiating as Open Source projects. This approach aligns with our vision to foster cooperation, openness, and shared growth in the digital transformation of railways. Participants were encouraged to explore and adapt innovative models, leveraging open data to drive progress across the industry.

The hackathon showcased impressive solutions to real-world rail challenges through collaborative efforts:

* **Brave New Station**: Enhanced passenger count analysis at stations using near-real-time data for improved safety and operational efficiency.
* **LoCo2 LoCo**: A smart COâ‚‚ dashboard for real-time emissions tracking, promoting sustainable travel strategies.
* **Trip HackerZ**: Personalized travel solutions using natural language processing to tailor travel experiences to individual needs.
* **Parametric Travelers**: A tool that recommends travel options based on personalized criteria, encouraging exploration of lesser-known connections.

These winning projects exemplify the transformative potential of Open Source collaboration, which OpenRail Association is committed to nurturing. By collaborating and sharing insights, the railway industry can accelerate innovation and achieve more efficient and interoperable solutions.
