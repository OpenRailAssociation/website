At FOSDEM 2025 we had a very successful [Railways and Open Transport Devroom](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/railways/) again, for the third consecutive year. The program and the room were packed with a load of interesting topics and people.

Topics ranged from implementation of European standards, over presentations from OpenRail projects such as Open Source Railway Designer and Netzgrafikeditor, to routing, and a report about a real train trip on the HackerTrain.

Recordings of all presentations are available on the FOSDEM website on the pages of the [respective presentations](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/railways/).

It was great to see the interest and passion of the community again, and how new ideas are born from bringing people together.
