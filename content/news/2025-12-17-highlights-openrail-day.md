On December 17, 2025, the OpenRail Association brought together the open-source railway community in Paris for the first edition of OpenRail Day @Paris.
 
This first edition laid the groundwork for a new community-driven event dedicated to open-source railway innovation, focused on collaboration, knowledge sharing and collective action.
 
Nearly 1.000 open source railway enthusiasts took part in:
* live demonstrations of open-source railway projects,
* technical and strategic discussions,
* collaborative workshops,
* and numerous meetings between railway, digital and open-source stakeholders from several countries.
 
🎤 Key insights from the day
* **Jochen Decker** outlined common challenges faced by railways everywhere and the potential of open source to address them.
* **François Davenne** highlighted the importance of open collaboration, interoperability, and the role of the OpenRail Association in enabling them.
* The European Commission (EC Open Source Programme Office) shared its vision on open source, interoperability and cross-sector collaboration at the European level, represented by **Miguel Díez Blanco** and **Catalin Moruju**.

💬 Panel discussion with **Lucian Balea** (LF Energy, RTE France), **Fatima Zohra EL Ouerkhaoui** (ONCF), **Daniel Woithe** (DB Systel), **Peter Franken** (Infrabel), **Pierre Tane** (UIC), and **Loïc Hamelin** (SNCF), moderated by **Amel Charleux** (University of Montpellier), the panel explored:
* The value of open source in railways
* Real-world experiences
* Ways to shape the future of open collaboration in the sector

🚀 The journey has just begun — we look forward to building this community together!
