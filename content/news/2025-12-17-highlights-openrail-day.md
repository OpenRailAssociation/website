On December 17, 2025, the OpenRail Association brought together the open-source railway community in Paris for the first edition of OpenRail Day @Paris.
 
This first edition laid the groundwork for a new community-driven event dedicated to open-source railway innovation, focused on collaboration, knowledge sharing and collective action.
 
Nearly 1.000 open source railway enthusiasts took part in:
* live demonstrations of [OSRD](https://clip.place/w/p/gZ1HFxLxHri8mDABzqpGHC?playlistPosition=4&resume=true), [NGE](https://clip.place/w/p/gZ1HFxLxHri8mDABzqpGHC?playlistPosition=5&resume=true), [LibLRS](https://clip.place/w/p/gZ1HFxLxHri8mDABzqpGHC?playlistPosition=6&resume=true) , [DAC Migration DSS](https://clip.place/w/p/gZ1HFxLxHri8mDABzqpGHC?playlistPosition=7&resume=true) and [RCM OSS](https://clip.place/w/p/gZ1HFxLxHri8mDABzqpGHC?playlistPosition=8&resume=true),
* technical and strategic discussions,
* collaborative workshops,
* and numerous meetings between railway, digital and open-source stakeholders from several countries.
