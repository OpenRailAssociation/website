### Introduction: Pioneering Open Source in the Railway Industry

Founded in 2024, the OpenRail Association has embarked on a mission to integrate open source principles into the railway sector, igniting collaboration and innovation among railway operators, infrastructure managers, and developers. This inaugural annual report marks the achievements of OpenRail's founding year, illustrating how open source methodologies can reshape the industry landscape.

"Railways are essential for sustainable mobility, with digitalization driving our future. Country-specific developments have led to isolated software systems. Traditional cooperation methods are lengthy and cumbersome. The OpenRail Association aims to revolutionize this by promoting low barrier community based open source approach to enhance interoperability, efficiency, and innovation," says Jochen Decker, Chair of the Board and CIO at SBB (Schweizerische Bundesbahnen).

### Looking Back: A Year of Progress

Since its launch in January 2024, OpenRail has established itself as a neutral, trusted space for railway stakeholders to collaborate on open software solutions. In its first year, it grew its community, launched five projects through a structured incubation process, and actively connected the ecosystem through key industry events.

### OpenRail Projects: Innovative Solutions for Railway Software

OpenRail onboarded five forward-thinking open source projects during 2024, each contributing to the advancement of railway software:

* **OSRD**: The Open Source Railway Designer, a tool for infrastructure simulation, timetabling, and short-term capacity planning.
* **RCM OSS**: Rail Condition Monitoring software designed around the open RCM-DX data format.
* **DAC Migration DSS**: A Decision Support System facilitating the transition to Digital Automatic Coupling in freight rail.
* **Netzgrafik-Editor (NGE)**: A graphical editor tailored for designing and analyzing regular-interval timetables.
* **libLRS**: A library developed for linear reference systems, aiding in the location of railway infrastructure along tracks.

### Full Steam Ahead: Building the Organization

The formal incorporation of the OpenRail Association as an international non-profit under Belgian law in 2024 marked a significant milestone. Supported by a burgeoning Board of Directors and the formation of the Technical Committee, the organization has laid a robust foundation for effective governance, incubation, and collaborative efforts.

### Expanding Horizons: Scaling Collaborative Efforts

As the OpenRail Association moves into 2025, the focus is on scaling project initiatives, attracting new contributions, and fostering strengthened collaboration between projects and members. By deepening cooperative actions within the railway sector, the OpenRail Association aims to broaden the adoption of open source solutions, ensuring their sustainability and impact.

### Join Us: Innovating Railway Software Together
