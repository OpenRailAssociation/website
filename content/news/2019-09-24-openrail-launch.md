We are launching the OpenRail brand in order to gather together and promote Open Source projects in the railway sector and foster the use of proofs of concept (POCs) and software developed within the railway community.

OpenRail will draw upon the many advantages of Open Source in order to disseminate and enhance development in digital technologies.

It will facilitate identification of Open Source licences to ensure interoperability and project compatibility.

Finally, OpenRail will enable consolidation of Open Source projects to better identify possible synergies. "Share-Open-Connect"

The initiative is initially driven by DB, SBB, SNCF, and UIC. We are looking forward to work with more interested stakeholders in the railway sector.
