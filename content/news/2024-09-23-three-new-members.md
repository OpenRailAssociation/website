The OpenRail Association is pleased to announce the membership of three new organisations: Infrabel from Belgium, Entur from Norway, and the Switzerland-registered Flatland Association. Their addition will enhance OpenRail's diversity and contribute to the collaborative culture we are establishing in the railway and transportation sector.

Already before the official inauguration of the OpenRail Association, the goal of the four founding members — DB, SBB, SNCF, and UIC — has been clear: to establish Open Source collaboration in the sector, a broad range of diverse actors must join forces. No single company, nor even a collaboration between two or three, will ever be powerful enough to address the shared digitisation challenges and create an innovative ecosystem that can be openly used.

This is why the OpenRail Association has been designed to be accessible to all organisations and companies active in the sector and sharing this vision, whether they are railway companies, infrastructure managers, suppliers and service providers, or related non-profit organisations and researchers. Thus, our new members will play a pivotal role in bringing this shared vision to reality.

### Our New Members in Detail

Our newest Gold member is **Infrabel**. Infrabel is the Belgian railway infrastructure manager responsible for maintaining, modernising, and developing the country's railway network. They oversee tracks, signalling systems, and rail traffic control to ensure safe and efficient train operations. Infrabel plays a key role in coordinating with train operators to provide reliable passenger and freight services across Belgium.

> "Many years ago, the Belgian rail network became the physical crossroads of the European high-speed rail network. Today, thanks to collaborative work based on Open Source, it is our ambition to become a breeding ground for innovation and a European crossroads for shared digital solutions. I am therefore proud and excited to see Infrabel join the pioneering ranks of the OpenRail Association. Together, let's develop the mobility solutions of the future and help Europe accomplish its digital transformation!" -- **Benoît Gilson**, CEO Infrabel

Joining as a Silver member, **Entur** is a Norwegian company that provides digital services for public transportation and mobility, offering a nationwide platform for travel planning and ticketing. They aggregate data from all transport operators in Norway, making it easier for passengers to plan journeys and purchase tickets across different modes of transportation. Entur aims to simplify travel within Norway by integrating information and services into one cohesive system.

> "To reach political goals for more green and sustainable mobility, Entur is established as a digital enabler within the mobility sector in Norway. Through strategic work for using open digital standards, open data and services, and Open Source technical platforms, Entur established digital infrastructure for the mobility sector in Norway. We believe an open, collaborative approach is the key to developing the sector and making it easier to help people choose public transport as their primary choice for transport both nationally and across borders." -- **Christel Borge**, CEO Entur

Finally, as an Associate member, the **Flatland Association** strengthens our ties with academia. The non-profit organization, based in Bern, Switzerland, was founded in July 2023. The Flatland Association aims to promote open research and the translation of research findings into practical applications, particularly in the field of resource optimization using computer science methods.

> "The Flatland Association is honored to join the OpenRail Association, contributing our expertise in open and translational research. We help industries openly share their challenges with the global research community, offering a platform that fosters collaboration through benchmarks and digital tools. Rooted in solving resource allocation problems, we have evolved to facilitate open research and the development of Open Source approaches to tackle the complex challenges of the railway sector and beyond. By enabling a global network of researchers and enthusiasts to address industry-relevant challenges, we aim to drive innovation and support the discovery of replicable, sustainable solutions for the future of transportation." -- **Erik Nygren**, President Flatland Association
