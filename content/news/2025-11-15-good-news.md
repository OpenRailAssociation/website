Good news for railway and open source enthusiasts!
OpenRail Association is pleased to release a public version of the OSRD (Open Source Railway Designer) demonstrator, the open-source platform for timetable design and simulation.
This public environment lets anyone test the application for free using sample data:
* compute train timetables
* detect conflicts
* explore eco-driving
* view reticular timetable diagrams
* plot train paths
* edit infrastructure
* create rolling stock
… and much more.

The OSRD project, supported by funding from the French State, the European Union, and SNCF Réseau, keeps improving notably thanks to cooperation with Netzgrafik-Editor (SBB)  
🔁 The environment is continuously updated and reset every day.
