FOSDEM is Europe's largest gathering of Free and Open Source Software developers and enthusiasts, with thousands of people attending and hundreds of talks taking place each year. For the second time, there will be a **Railways and Open Transport devroom** after its [well-received debut in 2023](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/railways_and_open_transport/). Proposals for presentations are welcome.

FOSDEM 2024 will take place on the weekend of 3 and 4 February 2024 in Brussels at the ULB university. The mentioned devroom covers the whole Saturday morning. It is a perfect opportunity for the wider community to get to know each other, learn and connect as the audience is developers and enthusiasts of Open Source. This includes a good number of railway fans and people active in related communities.

Several people involved in the OpenRail Association are coordinators of the devroom. We look forward to many interesting proposals from the OpenRail community. More information on how to submit talks can be found on the [landing page of the devroom](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/FOSDEM/blob/main/2024-cfp.md).
