    "no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else"
  </blockquote>
  <p>
      According to Joy's Law, attributed to Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill
      Joy, the brightest people - at the heart of corporate innovation - often
      work for others.
  </p>

  <p>
      To face this situation, the largest companies in the world are adopting
      so-called open innovation strategies. Open innovation allows both to
      foster internal innovation thanks to the contribution of resources outside
      the company (flow called outside - in); and to stimulate innovation within
      the broader ecosystem by allowing the development of ideas outside the
      company's borders (flow called inside - out).
  </p>

  <blockquote>
      <b>Open Source is a form of open innovation designed for software
      development and complex systems.</b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
      From Microsoft to IBM, Tesla to Airbus, Open Source methods and solutions
      are no longer in question. Open Source consists in opening the source code
      of a software so that everyone can read it, use it, and suggest
      improvements. Everyone can adapt the software to their own requirements
      and needs, while sharing their innovations with a large community.
      Development issues are therefore shared. Bugs, their resolution and the
      efforts made to fix them are public, as well as the progress of new
      features.
