  <p>
      Over the years, many private or commercial initiatives have
      resulted in valuable, but mostly "in- house" applications or
      frameworks. These disconnected initiatives necessarily
      overlap, within a context of constrained IT development
      resources.
  </p>

  <h3>Efficiency and Rationalization of efforts</h3>
  <p>
      The objective of the OpenRail Association Initiative is to
      provide an open space to foster innovation and software
      development in the railway sector.
  </p>
  <p>
      Software development activity is now an inherent part of
      rail operations, and all players have IT teams working on
      internal projects. Often using tools provided by private
      software publishers, these teams continually create value.
      They know the needs and constraints of the business. They
      can innovate and propose reliable technical solutions. They
      are already doing this, but in isolation.
      <br>OpenRail Association wishes to federate all the efforts
      that are made by IT teams around the world in open,
      collaborative, scalable and robust software projects.

      <b>IT projects by the railways and for the
          railways.</b>

  <h3>Meeting Basic Needs</h3>
  <p>
      The rail industry collectively needs a set of affordable,
      well-understood, reliable, and maintained software tools to
      perform basic analyses of their customers' needs, business
      assets, or environmental impact of their operations.
